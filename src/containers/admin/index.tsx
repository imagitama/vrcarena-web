                  Whenever someone creates or edits any record anywhere, the
                  site records what fields were modified. This table outputs a
                  simple and filtered list of events on the site.

                <p>
                  You can view the history of any asset by scrolling to the
                  bottom of its page.

                  These are reports for any user-created on the site (assets,
                  comments, authors, reviews, etc.) to ensure our high quality
                  and we do not have offensive content.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When a report comes in try your best to "verify" their claim
                  and respond to it. Then change the resolution status to
                  "resolved" and put a comment as to what you did (note this is
                  visible to the reporter).

                  claim. Sometimes they take down the asset from their Gumroad
                  page etc. and it needs to be taken down here too.

                  These are submissions by <em>anyone</em> for VRChat avatar IDs
                  for an avatar on the site. They are shown under the

                  It shows every existing submission and every new one. Pick and
                  choose what the <strong>final result</strong> will be.

                  If an avatar <em>looks</em> correct (it has a visibly similar
                  thumbnail, title and description) then just add it. If it
                  looks weird and nothing like the original avatar then uncheck
                  the box.
